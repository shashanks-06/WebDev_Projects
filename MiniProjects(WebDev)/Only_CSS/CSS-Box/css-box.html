                 "The Solitary Reaper" is a lyric by 
                 English Romantic poet William Wordsworth, 
                 and one of his best-known works. The poem 
                 was inspired by him and his sister Dorothy's 
                 stay at the village of Strathyre in the parish 
                 of Balquhidder in Scotland in September 1803.
         
                "The Solitary Reaper" is one of Wordsworth's 
                most famous post-Lyrical Ballads lyrics. 
                The words of the reaper's song are incomprehensible 
                to the speaker, so his attention is free to focus 
                on the tone, expressive beauty and the blissful 
                mood it creates in him. The poem functions to "praise 
                the beauty of music and its fluid expressive beauty", 
                the "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it 
                takes its origin from emotion recollected in 
                tranquillity" that Wordsworth identified at the 
                heart of poetry.
