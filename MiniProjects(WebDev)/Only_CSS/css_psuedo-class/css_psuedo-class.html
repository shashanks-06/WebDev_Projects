        William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, and actor
        born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. ... Shakespeare was a prolific
        writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages of British theatre
        (sometimes called the English Renaissance or the Early Modern Period).

        Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At
        the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three
        children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and
        1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and
        part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later
        known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have
        retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of
        Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable
        speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his
        sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to
        him were written by others.
