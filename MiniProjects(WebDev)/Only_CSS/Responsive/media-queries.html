      The most notable thing about Time is that it is so purely relative. A
      large amount of reminiscence is, by common consent, conceded to the
      drowning man; and it is not past belief that one may review an entire
      courtship while removing one's gloves.

      The Cactus Enthusiast, Carl Spitzweg, 1850That is what Trysdale was doing,
      standing by a table in his partments. On the table stood a
      singular-looking green plant in a red earthen jar. The plant was one of
      the species of cacti, and was provided with long leaves.

      Trysdale's friend, the brother of the bride, stood at a sideboard
      complaining at being allowed to drink alone. Both men were in evening
      dress. White favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of
      the apartment. As he slowly unbuttoned his gloves, there passed through
      Trysdale's mind a swift, scarifying retrospect of the last few hours. It
      seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had
      been banked in odorous masses about the church, and in his ears the
      lowpitched hum of a thousand well-bred voices, the rustle of crisp
      garments, and, most insistently recurring, the drawling words of the
      minister irrevocably binding her to another.
